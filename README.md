# LilysFoulCreatures
This is an Arma 3 mod that I am working on. It is a Love/Thank You letter to the content creators who introduced me to this game via lovely YouTube content. mainly RubixRaptor and Ignis since ive definitly rewatched those videos so many times.
Anyways this is all spaghetti code and im not sorry about it. The to do list is long but ill drop it down here. 
1. Custom Models with textures
2. custom animations
3. custom Ai stuff
4. polish it out to fit into arma and NOT break servers (so help me gods)
5. flesh out groups with hordes of the little guys and maybe some mixed medium and small guys.
6. anything else i think of along the way
7. fixing this readme down the line

Im going to make it ACE medical compatible but in its early forms it will not be until i finish and post it to the workshop.
